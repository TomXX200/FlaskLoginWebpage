# FlaskLoginWebpage
This project is a basic Flask web application featuring a custom built login system. It handles user authentication using data stored in a local JSON file, and manages sessions to restrict access to protected routes.

Make sure to have Flask installed and run the app.py using ~python app.py~ in a terminal.

Also run the html webpage (login.html) and use the login details user and 1234 to test functionality
